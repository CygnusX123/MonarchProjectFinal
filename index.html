        <h2 id="homeText">My Monarch Story</h2>
        <p id="paragraphText">I have always been an avid gardener and enjoyed the many bees and butterflies that visit my plants and flowers. I  noticed over the years that I was seeing less and less monarch butterflies. I became interested in helping the monarch butterflies when I learned they were on the threatened list (they are now on the Endangered Species List). I found out some information and a few years ago planted some native milkweed. I was thrilled to watch the caterpillars as they grew from one stage to the next. Unfortunately, one day I went out to check on their progress and found that most were gone and some were dead. Each day I went out and the situation was worse. I don’t think any of them survived.<br>
   <br>      
That’s when I did more research and found out that in the wild, only about two to five caterpillars will hatch and make it to adulthood from the hundreds of eggs laid by the female monarch. That led to my eventual raising of monarch caterpillars and much more research of monarch habitat, life cyle and ways to help these mighty migrators. Here is some of the information I have found.
